TAPIR is a rapid-plotting platform for the web. It does light-duty statistical aggregation, and about 90% of the standard library of statistical graphics. If you want a scatterplot in 30 seconds with no code, TAPIR is for you.

It's mostly based on [Raptr](https://github.com/cargomoose/raptR), only with a vastly modified UI.

OK, so what is *a* Tapir?
